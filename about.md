Coding Club at the University of York is an informal group for people who work with research software.
We get together every other week, and run two main types of meetup.

**Drop-in Code Clinic**: a group call on which you can discuss problems / ideas / anything around the 
topic of research software. Somebody will do their best to point you in the right direction on a problem,
and all will be happy just to chat!

**Seminars**: we invite people from around the university to deliver a short talk (up to an hour) on a topic 
of interest. These can be pitched at any level, and usually end with a lively discussion. Some topics we've 
covered are:

* Version control
* Numerical programming with Python
* Software testing
* Introductory Bioinformatics
* Understanding modern CPUs
* The Software Sustainability Institute

and you can see a (mostly!) full list of past seminars on the website homepage.

Subscribe to [our mailing list][1] (you will need to sign into your University of York account) to
get updates on upcoming meetings.

We also have a [Slack channel][2] on the University of York Slack workspace, where you can drop in
any time to get help and advice. This is currently only available to staff and research
postgraduate students.
